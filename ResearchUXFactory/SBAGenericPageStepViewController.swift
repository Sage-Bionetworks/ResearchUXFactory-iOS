    // TODO: Josh Bruhin, 6-13-17 - find a way to optionally remove the leftBarButtonItem.
    // Our configuration has an option to show our back button in the navigationView instead of the
    // navigationBar. Normally, this is done at the SBAGenericStepViewController level, but when a
    // pageViewController is being used - like for consent - it's done at that level. So, we need to
    // be able to check our configuration and optionally remove the leftBarButtonItem.
    
    // Problem is, super sets the leftBarButtonItem in the completion block of its pageViewController.setViewControllers()
    // method, which fires after all the potential overridable methods we have. This also fires after the
    // viewWillAppear() method of the stepVC for each scene, which is too bad because we could do it
    // there, too. We could just override super's goToStep() method, but there's a fair bit of functionality
    // there using some stuff we don't have access to.
